You are painting a wall. 
The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. 
Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5

                           = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

Example Input
	test_h = 3
	test_w = 9
Example Output
	You'll need 6 cans of paint.
