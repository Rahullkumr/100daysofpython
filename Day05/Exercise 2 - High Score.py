'''
You are going to write a program that calculates 
the highest score from a List of scores.

You are not allowed to use the max() or min(). 
The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: x

Example Input
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: 
[78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Example Output
The highest score in the class is: 91

for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):

print(student_scores)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

highest = student_scores[0]

for eachElement in student_scores:
    if eachElement > highest:
        highest = eachElement
