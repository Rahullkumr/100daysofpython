'''
You are going to write a program that calculates 
the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. 
You should try to replicate their functionality using for loops.
